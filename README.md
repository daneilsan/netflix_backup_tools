# How to use this

* With Chrome browser, open the extension menu or just navigate to chrome://extensions/
* Drag the `netflix_ratings_exporter.user.js` file into it
* Now navigate to https://www.netflix.com/MoviesYouveSeen
* Scroll to the bottom (it may take some time if you have a large collection of ratings), and you will see a button with the text `Export`
* Press that button and you will get a .json file with all your ratings


# Roadmap

In the future you will be able to import the exported .json
